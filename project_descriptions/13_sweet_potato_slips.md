This mini-project was focused on prototyping a sweet potato slip handling system. This was aimed at automating slip handling during sweet potato planting. I worked on the creation of an imaging system to develop a computer vision system that can accurately determine the position of individual slip. I used a Mynt Eye stereo camera was used, and created a simple GUI using R-QT to trigger the camera and record images. The mechanical system needed a manipulator to pick up the delicate slips. I designed some end effector geometries in Solidworks and 3D printed them for tests. I also later supervised an undergraduate student to further develop this project for picking up the slips.
