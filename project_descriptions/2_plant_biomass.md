# Measureing Plant Biomass with RGB Images

Using RGB images to predict the fresh biomass of maize plants was my first project based on the analysis of plant images. I used MATLAB to segment the plant pixels and calculated the area covered by the plants in pixels and metric units. These values were then used to model for fresh biomass. The images used here were derived from the Lemnatec plant phenotyping greenhouse. When using the top view images for this purpose, since the camera was stationary, the plants gradually moved towards the camera. The plants are also getting bigger as they do this, but the distortion caused by the change in distance caused the accuracy of the model to drop. Using the side view images worked quite well. We also found differences in model accuracy for different genotypes.
