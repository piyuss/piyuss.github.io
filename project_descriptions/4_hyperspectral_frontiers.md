In 2016, I worked with the newly established Lemnatec Plant Phenotyping platform at UNL to calibrate the
hyperspectral images and use maize and soybean images to predict leaft chemical properties. Among all the chemical properties investigated, water content was predicted with the highest accuracy
 [R2 = 0.93 and RPD (Ratio of Performance to Deviation) = 3.8]. All macronutrients were also quantified 
 satisfactorily (R2 from 0.69 to 0.92, RPD from 1.62 to 3.62), with N predicted best followed by P, K, and S. 
 The micronutrients group showed lower prediction accuracy (R2 from 0.19 to 0.86, RPD from 1.09 to 2.69) than 
 the macronutrient groups. Cu and Zn were best predicted, followed by Fe and Mn. Na and B were the only two 
 properties that hyperspectral imaging was not able to quantify satisfactorily (R2 < 0.3 and RPD < 1.2). You can
