Robotic system for controlled crosses in loblolly pine

As part of my PhD research, I worked on the development of a prototype pollinating robot comprised of a parallel manipulator with a pollen injecting mechanism and a perception system equipped with a stereovision camera. From preliminary tests conducted with the prototype, it was quickly identified that the most important problem in delivering pollen into exclusion bags was the successful insertion of the pollinator needle into the bag. A ``claw'' mechanism with a stabilizing link and a pollinator link was developed for this purpose. A simple spring-based mechanism for the verification of needle insertion was also developed and tested. The perception system is aimed at delivering pollen inside an exclusion bag once the pollinating device has been brought into close proximity of the bag such that the needle can be inserted with manipulator motion within its workspace. In order to recognize the location of the target exclusion bag, an object detection model was trained for the detection of the bags. The depth information from the stereovision camera was combined with the bounding box data obtained from the bag detection model to calculate the position of the exclusion bag. The software for image acquisition and processing was developed using the Robot Operating System (ROS).
