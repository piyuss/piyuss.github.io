#Manual Citrus Grading Machine

The citrus grading machine was a part of my undergraduate research thesis on machine design. The problem was to design a portable fruit grading machine that could work without electric power. The solution uses a series of inclined tubes with the spacing between them gradually increasing as we go down the incline. The smallest fruits will slip down the gaps first and the largest fruits roll down all the way to the foot of the incline. The inclined tubes have a manually operated rotating mechanism that perturbs the fruits. This is to avoid the fruits from getting stuck due to friction. The angle of inclination had to be based on iterative experimentation to find out the coefficient of friction between the fruits and the inclined tubes. The system also needed careful design to ensure gentle landing of the fruits after slipping through the gaps.
