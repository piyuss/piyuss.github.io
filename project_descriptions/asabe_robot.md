# (Tabletop) Raspberry Cane Pruning Robot

This was a student robotics competition where I was a team member at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln. The robot was supposed to walk down the table and for every "plot" of "raspberry canes" on the table, it needed to trim only a certain number of green or yellow canes. We had a robot arm with blades on its end effector for cutting the canes and an articulated crank mechanism that would send a raspberry pi camera to the top of the plot for image acquisition. We needed the crank because the robot needs to fold up nicely within dimensions for the competition. My job was to use the images and produce 3D coordinates for each cane so that the arm could go and cut them. I was initially planning to use a depth camera but then realized that the grid of canes resembles a camera calibration checkerboard. The size of the grid and the distance between the canes was fixed, so once I detected the canes and the empty holes, all I needed was the camera intrinsics to find the 3D coordinates. We got the second prize in the competition.
