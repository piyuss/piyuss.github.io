# Time Series Imaging of Maize Lines Used in Field Trials

This was the result of a collaboration with plant geneticists at UNL where my contribution was primarily in the image processing, including hyperspectral data calibration and analysis. a set of maize inbreds—primarily recently off patent lines—were phenotyped using a high-throughput platform. These lines have been previously subjected to high-density genotyping and scored for a core set of 13 phenotypes in field trials across 13 North American states in 2 years by the Genomes 2 Fields Consortium. We released a total of 485 GB of image data including RGB, hyperspectral, fluorescence, and thermal infrared photos has been released. Correlations between image-based measurements and manual measurements demonstrated the feasibility of quantifying variation in plant architecture using image data. However, naive approaches to measuring traits such as biomass can introduce nonrandom measurement errors confounded with genotype variation. Analysis of hyperspectral image data demonstrated unique signatures from stem tissue. Integrating heritable phenotypes from high-throughput phenotyping data with field data from different environments can reveal previously unknown factors that influence yield plasticity.
