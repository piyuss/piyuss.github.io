Hello! I am a doctoral student at North Carolina State University working towards a dual PhD in Engineering and Forestry. I have a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and a Master's degree in Biological and Agricultural Systems Engineering. I am interested in the application of computer vision and robotics to biological systems. 

## Current Projects:

__Hyperspectral image analysis for phenotyping of loblolly pine__    

![image](/images/data_acquisition.png)    

In this project, we are studying the possibility of detecting biological stress in loblolly pine seedlings using VIS-NIR imaging. In the picture, you can see a diseased pine seedling infected with *Fusarium* rust on the left and the hyperspectral imaging setup on the right. Our experiment with *Fusarium* uses data from 2500 seedlings from 87 families! You can read more about these projects [here](https://elibrary.asabe.org/abstract.asp?aid=51616) and [here](https://elibrary.asabe.org/abstract.asp?aid=51561).

__Robots for automated controlled pollination__

This is a schematic of an automated pollination system with a UAV with a parallel manipulator carrying a pollinating device.

And this is how controlled pollination is done manually! You can see details about this project [here](/_posts/2020-11-20-poster1.md)
