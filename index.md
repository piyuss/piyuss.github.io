Hello! I am a doctoral student at North Carolina State University working towards a dual PhD in Engineering and Forestry. I have a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and a Master's degree in Biological and Agricultural Systems Engineering. I am interested in the application of computer vision and robotics to biological systems. 

## Current Projects:

__Hyperspectral image analysis for phenotyping of loblolly pine__

<<<<<<< HEAD
In this project, we are studying the possibility of detecting biological stress in loblolly pine seedlings using VIS-NIR imaging. In the picture, you can see a diseased pine seedling infected with fusiform rust on the left and the hyperspectral imaging setup on the right. Our experiment with fusiform data from 2500 seedlings from 87 families! You can read more about these projects [here](https://elibrary.asabe.org/abstract.asp?aid=51616) and [here](https://elibrary.asabe.org/abstract.asp?aid=51561).

__Robots for automated controlled pollination__

This is a schematic of an automated pollination system with a UAV with a parallel manipulator carrying a pollinating device.

And this is how controlled pollination is done manually. You can see details about this project [here](/_posts/2020-11-20-poster1.md)
