                            The detection of individual plants within field images is critical for many applications in precision agriculture and research. Computer vision models for object detection, while often highly accurate, require large amounts of labeled data for training, something that is not readily available for most plants. To address the challenge of creating large datasets with accurate labels, we used indoor images of maize plants to create synthetic field images with automatically derived bounding box labels, enabling the generation of thousands of synthetic images without any manual labeling. Training an object detection model (Faster R-CNN) exclusively on synthetic images led to a mean average precision (mAP) value of 0.533 when the model was evaluated on pre-processed real plot images. When fine-tuned with a small number of real plot images, the model pre-trained on the synthetic images (mAP=0.884) outperformed the model that was not pre-trained.

                            Loblolly pine is an economically important timber species in the United States, with almost 1 billion seedlings produced annually. The most significant disease affecting this species is fusiform rust, caused by Cronartium quercuum f. sp. fusiforme. Testing for disease resistance in the greenhouse involves artificial inoculation of seedlings followed by visual inspection for disease incidence. An automated, high-throughput phenotyping method could improve both the efficiency and accuracy of the disease screening process. This study investigates the use of hyperspectral imaging for the detection of diseased seedlings. A nursery trial comprising families with known in-field rust resistance data was conducted, and the seedlings were artificially inoculated with fungal spores. Hyperspectral images in the visible and near-infrared region (400â€“1000 nm) were collected six months after inoculation. The disease incidence was scored with traditional methods based on the presence or absence of visible stem galls. The seedlings were segmented from the background by thresholding normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images, and the delineation of individual seedlings was achieved through object detection using the Faster RCNN model. Plant parts were subsequently segmented using the DeepLabv3+ model. The trained DeepLabv3+ model for semantic segmentation achieved a pixel accuracy of 0.76 and a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.62. Crown pixels were segmented using geometric features. Support vector machine discrimination models were built for classifying the plants into diseased and non-diseased classes based on spectral data, and balanced accuracy values were calculated for the comparison of model performance. Averaged spectra from the whole plant (balanced accuracy = 61%), the crown (61%), the top half of the stem (77%), and the bottom half of the stem (62%) were used. A classification model built using the spectral data from the top half of the stem was found to be the most accurate, and resulted in an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.83.

                            As part of my PhD research, I worked on the development of a prototype pollinating robot comprised of a parallel manipulator with a pollen injecting mechanism and a perception system equipped with a stereovision camera. From preliminary tests conducted with the prototype, it was quickly identified that the most important problem in delivering pollen into exclusion bags was the successful insertion of the pollinator needle into the bag. A ``claw'' mechanism with a stabilizing link and a pollinator link was developed for this purpose. A simple spring-based mechanism for the verification of needle insertion was also developed and tested. The perception system is aimed at delivering pollen inside an exclusion bag once the pollinating device has been brought into close proximity of the bag such that the needle can be inserted with manipulator motion within its workspace. In order to recognize the location of the target exclusion bag, an object detection model was trained for the detection of the bags. The depth information from the stereovision camera was combined with the bounding box data obtained from the bag detection model to calculate the position of the exclusion bag. The software for image acquisition and processing was developed using the Robot Operating System (ROS).

                            This mini-project was focused on prototyping a sweet potato slip handling system. This was aimed at automating slip handling during sweet potato planting. I worked on the creation of an imaging system to develop a computer vision system that can accurately determine the position of individual slip. I used a Mynt Eye stereo camera was used, and created a simple GUI using R-QT to trigger the camera and record images. The mechanical system needed a manipulator to pick up the delicate slips. I designed some end effector geometries in Solidworks and 3D printed them for tests. I also later supervised an undergraduate student to further develop this project for picking up the slips.

                                This was a student robotics competition where I was a team member at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln. The robot was supposed to walk down the table and for every "plot" of "raspberry canes" on the table, it needed to trim only a certain number of green or yellow canes. We had a robot arm with blades on its end effector for cutting the canes and an articulated crank mechanism that would send a Raspberry Pi camera to the top of the plot for image acquisition. 
                                
                                </p>

                                I was in charge of the vision system and my specific responsibility was to use the images and produce 3D coordinates for each cane so that the arm could go and cut them. I was initially planning to use a depth camera but then realized that the grid of canes resembles a camera calibration checkerboard. The size of the grid and the distance between the canes was fixed, so once I detected the canes and the empty holes, all I needed was the camera intrinsics to find the 3D coordinates. We got the second prize in the competition.

                             This study investigated \textit{in situ} hyperspectral imaging of hydroponic lettuce for predicting nutrient concentrations and identifying nutrient deficiencies for: nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and {\color{red}{sulphur}} (S). Plants were imaged using a hyperspectral line scanner at six and eight weeks after transplanting, then plant tissue was sampled, and nutrient concentrations measured. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) models were developed to predict nutrient concentrations for each nutrient individually (PLS1) and for all six nutrient concentrations (PLS2). Several binary classification models were also developed to predict nutrient deficiencies. The PLS1 and PLS2 models predicted nutrient concentrations with R^2 values from 0.60-0.88 for N, P, K, and S, while results for Ca and Mg yielded R^2 values of 0.12-0.34, for both harvest dates. Similarly, plants deficient in N, P, K, and S were classified more accurately compared to plants deficient in Ca and Mg for both harvest dates, with F1 values (F-scores) ranging from 0.71 to 1.00, with the exception of K which had F1 scores of 0.40-0.67. Overall, results indicate that both leaf tissue nutrient concentration and nutrient deficiencies can be predicted using hyperspectral data collected in-vivo.

                            The most important climatic variable influencing growth and survival of loblolly pine is the yearly average minimum winter temperature (MWT) at the seed source origin, and it is used to guide the transfer of improved seed lots throughout the speciesâ€™ distribution. This study presents a novel approach for the assessment of freeze-induced damage and prediction of MWT at seed source origin of loblolly pine seedlings using hyperspectral imaging. A population comprising 98 seed lots representing a wide range of MWT at seed source origin was subjected to an artificial freeze event. The visual assessment of freeze damage and MWT were evaluated at the family level and modeled with hyperspectral image data combined with chemometric techniques. Hyperspectral scanning of the seedlings was conducted prior to the freeze event and on four occasions periodically after the freeze. A significant relationship (R2 = 0.33; p < .001) between freeze damage and MWT was observed. Prediction accuracies of freeze damage and MWT based on hyperspectral data varied among seedling portions (full-length, top, middle, and bottom portion of aboveground material) and scanning dates. Models based on the top portion were the most predictive of both freeze damage and MWT. The highest prediction accuracy of MWT [RPD (ratio of prediction to deviation) = 2.12, R2 = 0.78] was achieved using hyperspectral data obtained prior to the freeze event. Adoption of this assessment method would greatly facilitate the characterization and deployment of well-adapted loblolly pine families across the landscape.

                            In 2016, I worked with the newly established Lemnatec Plant Phenotyping platform at UNL to calibrate the
                            hyperspectral images and use maize and soybean images to predict leaft chemical properties. Among all the chemical properties investigated, water content was predicted with the highest accuracy [R2 = 0.93 and RPD (Ratio of Performance to Deviation) = 3.8]. All macronutrients were also quantified satisfactorily (R2 from 0.69 to 0.92, RPD from 1.62 to 3.62), with N predicted best followed by P, K, and S. 
                             The micronutrients group showed lower prediction accuracy (R2 from 0.19 to 0.86, RPD from 1.09 to 2.69) than the macronutrient groups. Cu and Zn were best predicted, followed by Fe and Mn. Na and B were the only two properties that hyperspectral imaging was not able to quantify satisfactorily (R2 < 0.3 and RPD < 1.2).

                                    Using RGB images to predict the fresh biomass of maize plants was my first project based on the analysis of plant images. I used MATLAB to segment the plant pixels and calculated the area covered by the plants in pixels and metric units. These values were then used to model for fresh biomass. The images used here were derived from the Lemnatec plant phenotyping greenhouse. When using the top view images for this purpose, since the camera was stationary, the plants gradually moved towards the camera. The plants are also getting bigger as they do this, but the distortion caused by the change in distance caused the accuracy of the model to drop. Using the side view images worked quite well. We also found differences in model accuracy for different genotypes.
