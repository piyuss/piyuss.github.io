            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>Hello. I am an ORISE postdoctoral fellow at USDA-ARS working on plant phenotyping using deep learning methods.
                
                I completed my dual PhD in Engineering and Forestry at North Carolina State University. 
            </p>

            <p> I have worked on projects in high-throughput phenotyping of plants using digital images and 
                in robotic systems for forestry applications. Some of the projects are visualized
                in the slideshow below. Please use the links to publications and presentations on the navigation bar for
                 a more complete view of my work.

                            The detection of individual plants within field images is critical for many applications in precision agriculture and research. Computer vision models for object detection, while often highly accurate, require large amounts of labeled data for training, something that is not readily available for most plants. To address the challenge of creating large datasets with accurate labels, we used indoor images of maize plants to create synthetic field images with automatically derived bounding box labels, enabling the generation of thousands of synthetic images without any manual labeling. Training an object detection model (Faster R-CNN) exclusively on synthetic images led to a mean average precision (mAP) value of 0.533 when the model was evaluated on pre-processed real plot images. When fine-tuned with a small number of real plot images, the model pre-trained on the synthetic images (mAP=0.884) outperformed the model that was not pre-trained.

                            This was a student robotics competition where I was a team member at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln. The robot was supposed to walk down the table and for every "plot" of "raspberry canes" on the table, it needed to trim only a certain number of green or yellow canes. We had a robot arm with blades on its end effector for cutting the canes and an articulated crank mechanism that would send a Raspberry Pi camera to the top of the plot for image acquisition. 
                            
                            <br>
                            
                            I was in charge of the vision system and my specific responsibility was to use the images and produce 3D coordinates for each cane so that the arm could go and cut them. I was initially planning to use a depth camera but then realized that the grid of canes resembles a camera calibration checkerboard. The size of the grid and the distance between the canes was fixed, so once I detected the canes and the empty holes, all I needed was the camera intrinsics to find the 3D coordinates. We got the second prize in the competition.
